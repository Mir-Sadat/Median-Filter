The median filter is a non-linear digital filtering technique widely used to remove noise from images, particularly effective against salt-and-pepper noise. Unlike linear filters that compute the average of surrounding pixel values, the median filter replaces each pixel with the median value of its neighboring pixels within a defined window (e.g., 3×3 or 5×5). This method preserves edges better than averaging filters because the median is less sensitive to extreme values or outliers. When applied to multiband TIFF images, the filter processes each band independently, ensuring noise is reduced without blending or distorting spectral information across bands. As a result, the median filter is a robust choice for preserving fine image details while effectively smoothing out localized noise.
